Compiled .exe file path:
\lab-1\bin\Debug\net6.0\publish\lab-1.exe

Github:

The easiest way to run the program is to use IDE, and insert the command line arguments into the run configuration.
Another way would be to use dotnet publish to generate fresh .exe file in the location specified in the beginning of the readme.
